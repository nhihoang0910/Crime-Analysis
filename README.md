## Chicago Crime Data Analysis (2003 - 2023)

## Project Overview
This project explores crime data from Chicago between 2003 and 2023. The primary goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in crime occurrences based on time, location, and type of crime, and to analyze factors that influence crime resolution rates. The data was extracted, cleaned, and analyzed using Python. The Tableau visualization is in-progress.

## Data Source
The crime data used in this project comes from the official Chicago Data Portal: [Chicago Crime Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crimes-one-year-prior-to-present)

## Key Questions

### By Time:
- What are the long-term trends in overall crime rates?
- Which months or seasons experience higher crime rates, and are there any significant events influencing these changes?
- How do crime occurrences vary by time of day, and what types of crimes are more frequent at specific times?
- Are there patterns in crime resolution related to the time they occurred?

### By Type:
- What are the top 5 crime types in Chicago, and how have these patterns changed over time?
- Which crime types are increasing or decreasing in frequency?

### By Location:
- Which residential areas have high crime rates, and how have these rates evolved over time?
- What is the geographical distribution of crimes across Chicago, and what types of crimes are common in specific areas?
- Which locations within the top 5 crime-heavy communities see the highest crime rates?

### Crime Resolution and Arrests:
- What is the difference in resolution time between crimes that result in arrests and those that don't?
- How have unresolved crimes evolved over time, and what factors contribute to this disparity?
- What are the correlations between crime resolution rates and factors such as community, crime type, and time?
